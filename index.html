<ins>Common observations:</ins><br>
The vast majority or results can be explained by geographical or other common grounds between cuisines/countries. Other common grounds may include hystorical, political or cultural similarities. This can be well observed in Asian and Central Europen countries, they tend to gravitate towards eachother. This also confirms that our dataset is not corrupted and our calculations are correct.<br><br>
<ins>Uncommon observations:</ins><br>
While most of the results make sense, there are some anomalies in the results. The title indicates that something is wrong with Mexico. As mentioned before, calculations are correct so there must be something wrong with the data. But before we digg deeper into Mexico lets explain some minor deviations: <br><br>

MOROCCO: According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_cuisine" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> Moroccan cuisine is typically a mix of Mediterranean, Arabic, Andalusian and Berber cuisine. Which means that top 5 results should be from these areas. Spain is pretty high (7th) and Greece as well (6th). The abnormal parts are the top two results, Pakistan (makes some sense because of religion) and Bangladesh. Lebanon on 3rd place and Turkey on 5th make sense but India falls into the same basket as Pakistan and Bangladesh. This might be explained by the lack of data about Northern African cuisines - without doubt the results would have been different if we would have data about Algeria, Tunisia and other cuisines from that area. <br><br>

RUSSIA: Lack of data for Eastern Europe suggests the same problem as with Morocco and the sheer vastnesss of the country doesn't help but according to <a href="http://www.russian-plus.com/history-of-russian-cuisine-13889" target="_blank">this article</a> our data (strange as it looks, makes sense). The article says that 18th century was a new era in the development of Russian society. <a href="http://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/the-romanov-dynasty/peter-i/" target="_blank">Peter I</a> not only transferred the capital to St. Petersburg closer to the Western Europe and changed the calendar, he changed many traditions. Russia was becoming more and more influenced by western European cuisine, first German and then Dutch and French. The Russian aristocracy was hiring foreign chefs that totally replaced lady-cooks. If we observe our top results we get Austria, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. One must also distingush between Soviet and Russian cuisine. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_cuisine" target="_blank">Soviet cuisine</a> extends Russian boundries to all former Soviet republics and takes influences from their national cuisines. Most dishes were simplifications of French, Russian, and Austro-Hungarian cuisines. Caucasian cuisines, particularly Georgian cuisine, contributed as well.<br><br>

INDONESIA: Top three, according to our data, are Bangladesh, Pakistan and Philipines. The later can be easily explained by physical location but the first two come as a surprise. The two biggest islands in the archipelago are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java" target="_blank">Java</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatra" target="_blank">Sumatra</a> and according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> Sumatran cuisine often has Middle Eastern and Indian influences, featuring curried meat and vegetables while Javanese cuisine is mostly indigenous, with some hint of Chinese influence. The cuisines of Eastern Indonesia are similar to Polynesian and Melanesian cuisine. Colonial history explains the relatively high rankings of Portugal (13th), Spain (15th) and Netheralnds (18th).<br><br>

ISRAEL: Mostly infumenced by Jewish cuisine and incorporates many foods traditionally eaten in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. According to <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/2008/07/01/about-israeli-food" target="_blank">SBS</a> the influences on Jewish food can be divided into two different cuisines: that of the Ashkenazic and Sephardic.Ashkenazic refers to Jewish immigrants from Eastern and Western Europe. Sephardic refers to the Jewish people originating from the Middle Eastern countries. 
That would explain the top rankings of Europen countries. But according to the same article it has a strong Spanish and Portuguese influence. Well, our data shows Portugal on 12th place, Morocco on 14th and Spain at a very low 25th place. With the lack of data for most Middle Eastern countries we cannot confirm this but Turkey ranks pretty hight (8th) and Lebanon as well (16th). <br><br>
