Main topic of the project is recipes and cuisines that incorporate them. Based on the raw data, about the recipes, we tried to calculate the distance between different cuisines with respect to the ingredients they use in recipes.<br><br> The table on the left side can be used for navigation through the page.

It is a small town in a small country on the sunny side of Alps, they say. I was born on 8th of August 1989 in Kranj. I attended primary school in my hometown. All my further education has since then moved to Kranj (high school and University). Currently I am a Masters student at the University of Maribor. <br> <br> The rest of my CV is available <a href="CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. <br> <br> My primary field of studies is IT and the ways to manage and govern IT support in companies. I did my undergraduate thesis on comparison of different open source CRM tools and my graduate thesis is still under construction. <br> <br> In 2014 I decided that I want some international experience so I embarked myself to Istanbul as an exchange student at <a href="https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en" target="_blank">Sabanci University</a>. Probably one the most scary decisions that I have ever made, but the best one beyond any doubt. Well, needless to say that SU is a great University and during the time that I was there, one year and one week, I learned a lot and. Without any hesitation I would recommend SU to all exchange and full time students seeking for a stimulative environment in one of the greatest cities in the world. I have spent two semesters there and I also did my internship. It lasted for three months and was fully funded by Erasmus+ program. And this page is the final result of it. <br> <br> In my spare time I enjoy myself in nature by doing all sorts of outdoor activities (mainly climbing and hiking), as any other person I enjoy a good book and a good movie. And like many CS and IT people I am a big fan of The Lord of the Rings. </p> </div> <div id = "about_project"> <h2><a name="proj"></a>About the project:</h2> <p class = "normal_text"> Here, a short presentation of the project will be given. Full report is available <a href="REPORT.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. All the data used, code, queries and other materials can be obtained from my <a href="https://github.com/moserMatjaz/recipes_visalisation" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. This website is a result of my internship at Sabanci University in Istanbul under the mentorship of  <a href="http://people.sabanciuniv.edu/kaya/" target="_blank">Dr. Kamer Kaya</a>, an assistant professor at SU.<br><br> I have always been interested in data and databases but had little knowledge beyond the traditional relational model and SQL. This internship / project was a great opportunity to expand my knowledge to more recent field in the data sciences. <br><br> With this short text we would like to present, to the reader, the summary of our work from the start until the end. For interested readers we also provide a <a href="REPORT.pdf" target="_blank">full text</a> in which our work is described in detail. <br><br> <h3><a name="Data"></a>Data:</h3> <p class = "normal_text"> There were many ideas on what the topic of the project should be. We had the general framework set (very general: get some data and do something with it) but what kind of data. There was talk about reference datasets and protein-to-protein interaction but in the end we decided to do the work on recipes. It is more fun. <br><br> The data set was acquired from <a href="http://blog.bruggen.com/2013/12/fascinating-food-networks-in-neo4j.html" target="_blank">Van Bruggen's blog</a> and it needed much restructuring and beauty procedures. After we got the data ready we imported it in <a href="http://neo4j.com/" target="_blank">Neo4j</a>, a graph database. This is the part where I was given the opportunity to expand my knowledge. I had no idea what Neo4j is or what graph databases are. I must say I was intrigued instantly. <br><br> Once the data was in the database we started querying it using <a href="http://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/" target="_blank">Cypher</a>. I can say that at first I was quite lost but once you get the hang of it, it gets really fun. We were thinking of doing the majority of work in Neo4j but our system setup had some limitations that were unacceptable for us so we did the majority of heavy lifting with a scripting language, Python. <br><br> <h3><a name="Code"></a>Code:</h3> <p class = "normal_text"> As mentioned before, most of the heavy lifting was done outside of the database, using Python. Our main idea was to calculate the similarities between cuisines using the raw data from recipes.For the purpose of this we devised three different methods. These three different methods were then compared and tested. In the end the fastest one was chosen to be the calculating method for our cuisine similarities. <br><br> A rough description of our similarity would be: two recipes are more similar if they contain more mutual ingredients - two cuisines are more similar if they contain recipes that are (more)similar. This basically means that every recipe had to be compared to all others (given the dataset of 57691 recipes, this was not such an easy job) and time was of the essence. <br><br>After some long hours the code presented us with output. Results were promising and were imported to our database using standard CSV import procedures. <br><br> <h3><a name="Visualsiation"></a>Visualization:</h3> <p class = "normal_text"> Presenting the results of our work turned out to be the hardest thing to do. Prior to this internship I had little experience with web development and JavaScript in particular. Well, that changed. <br><br> There is a lot of different parameters that could be shown in the world map, our time was limited so we decided to show the results of our similarity calculations. <br><br> The results are displayed in a map since all the data is geographically oriented. We used <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> and with world data and <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/topojson" target="_blank">topoJSON</a> we devised a map that upon click shows most similar cuisines, to the clicked one, from our dataset. <br><br> Not all data is there (a lot of countries are missing from the dataset) but the ones that are there perform pretty well. But that is a limitation of our dataset <br><br> </p> <h3><a name="Website"></a>Website:</h3> <p class = "normal_text"> Once the data part, coding and visualization parts were finished there was time to build a web site. Main idea of the website is to present our project in the broadest way possible, with little details. <br><br> The site is built using standard HTML framework with combination of CSS and some animations written in JavaScript. Not much can be said about it so just take a tour and decide for yourself. <br><br> </p> <h3><a name="Comparisson"></a>Database comparison:</h3> <p class = "normal_text"> I am pretty familiar with the relational database model and have acquainted myself only recently, with the graph model. I have seen a lot of nice words being said about the performance of Neo4j compared to relational databases so we ran some tests. <br><br> We build two databases (one in Neo4j and the second one in MySQL) containing the same data with the same data model (as equal as possible). On this databases pre-written queries were ran (in Cypher and SQL). Execution time was the most important parameter of the comparison because all other parameters are beyond the scope of our little project. The other parameters (if not observed by ourselves) were derived from literature and contain security, ease of programing, maturity etc. <br><br> </p> </div> </div> <div id = "footer"> <div class = "folder"> <div class = "conectors"> <div class = "git"> <a href="https://github.com/moserMatjaz" target="_blank"><img src="github-icon.png"/></a> </div> <div class = "face"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/matjaz.moser" target="_blank"><img src="F_icon.png"/></a> </div> <div class = "linked"> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/matja%C5%BE-moser/88/410/b95" target="_blank"><img src="Linked_in.png"/></a> </div> <div class = "mail_to"> <a href="mailto:matjaz.moser@gmail.com" target="_blank"><img src="gmail.png"/></a> </div> <div class = "home"> <a href="index.html"><img src="home.png"/></a> </div> </div> </div> <div class = "head"> <h3 class = "footer_text_header">General information:</h3> <p class = "footer_text"> Name: Matjaz Moser</p> <p class = "footer_text"> Email: matjaz.moser[at]gmail.com</p> <p class = "footer_text"> Address: Grenc 34, 4220 Skofja Loka, Slovenia</p> <p class = "footer_text"> Profession: super awesome possessed by bananas</p> </div> </div> </body></html>
